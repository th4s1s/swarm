# vibehack - fpcheck: Parallel Static False-Positive Elimination

**Purpose**: Eliminate false positives via **static review only** - re-read every cited source file, apply 18 Hard Exclusions + 10 Precedent rules + Marginal Gain Test. No live testing in this phase (that's `verify`).

**Entry**: Audit done, `vh_findings` populated.
**Exit**: Every finding has a verdict in `vh_fp_verdicts`, per-batch artifacts written, resume note updated, user gate before verification forks.

---

## Step 1 - Verdicts table (pre-created)

`vh_fp_verdicts` is created at workspace init ([../schema.sql](../schema.sql)) - it already exists, do
**not** create it. Columns: `finding_id (PK), verdict (TRUE_POSITIVE|FALSE_POSITIVE|DUPLICATE), reason,
final_severity, final_id (F-N for report), merged_into (canonical id when DUPLICATE), reviewed_at`.

## Step 2 - Build batches

Read [../references/phase5-fp-check.md](../references/phase5-fp-check.md) for full batching rules. Quick version:

- **8-12 findings per batch** (3 min, 12 max)
- Batches by **feature group affinity** (shared code context = less re-reading)
- Spread CRITICAL/HIGH findings across batches (don't load them all in one)
- If you spot candidate duplicates pre-batch (e.g., same file:line cited twice), put them in the **same** batch

Letter your batches: A, B, C, D, E, F …

## Step 3 - Pre-flag known dedup pairs

Before launching FP-check, query for finding pairs that cite the same file:line or describe the same root cause across groups. Put a note in the relevant batch prompt:

> Suspected duplicates: `G<a>-F<b>` ↔ `G<c>-F<d>` (same root cause at `<file>:<line>`). If confirmed dup, mark `verdict=DUPLICATE` and set `merged_into` to the canonical (higher-confidence) finding.

## Step 4 - Spawn parallel FP-check subagents

**Agent type**: a **writable** subagent - a read-only agent cannot write the SQL inserts, so ALL verdicts would be lost. Use the strongest model available. See SKILL.md → *Tools & subagents*.

Spawn ONE subagent per batch, ALL in parallel.

Each subagent must:

1. Read [../references/phase5-fp-check.md](../references/phase5-fp-check.md) - the full false-positive methodology (bundled in this skill; no external skill required).
2. Use the canonical 18 Hard Exclusions + 10 Precedent rules from that reference's *Canonical FP Rules Summary*.
3. For EACH finding in the batch:
   - **Re-read every cited source file** at the cited lines (Capability Validity rule CV-3 - never trust the artifact's quoted code without re-verifying).
   - Apply all 18 Hard Exclusions.
   - Apply all 10 Precedent rules.
   - Apply the Marginal Gain Test (HE-17) - common FP source for operator-config findings.
   - Issue verdict: TRUE_POSITIVE / FALSE_POSITIVE / DUPLICATE.
   - INSERT into `vh_fp_verdicts`.
4. Write a per-batch artifact at `<AUDIT_DIR>/artifacts/phase5-batch<X>-<scope>.md` documenting each verdict with:
   - Cited file re-read excerpt
   - Which exclusion / precedent rule applied (for FPs)
   - Reason for keeping (for TPs)
   - Merge target (for DUPs)
5. Return a verdict tally.

**IMPORTANT for this phase**: Subagents must NOT use the live instance, must NOT edit any project files, and must NOT modify `vh_findings`. Static review only. Per-finding live testing is the next phase (`verify`).

## Step 5 - Sanity-check verdict completeness

```sql
SELECT
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vh_findings) AS findings,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vh_fp_verdicts) AS verdicts,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vh_fp_verdicts WHERE verdict='TRUE_POSITIVE') AS tp,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vh_fp_verdicts WHERE verdict='FALSE_POSITIVE') AS fp,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM vh_fp_verdicts WHERE verdict='DUPLICATE') AS dup;
```

If `findings != verdicts`, identify the missing batch and **re-spawn just that one** (with the `Task`/`Agent` tool, `general-purpose` - not `TaskCreate`/`TodoWrite`). If a spawn call errored, fix the call and retry it; do not write the verdicts inline in the orchestrator unless the correct spawn fails twice for that batch (see SKILL.md Essential Principle 11). (Common cause: agent stalled - see [../references/lessons-learned.md](../references/lessons-learned.md).)

## Step 6 - Assign final IDs

Order TPs by severity (CRITICAL → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW), then by group ID, then by original finding ID. Assign sequential `F-1, F-2, …`.

```sql
-- conceptual; do this in app code with proper ordering
UPDATE vh_fp_verdicts SET final_id = 'F-' || row_number
WHERE verdict='TRUE_POSITIVE';
```

## Step 7 - Resume-note + memory-pointer rewrite + fork plan

Rewrite the resume note (and the audit pointer in your memory, phase = fpcheck) with:

- Phase status: recon/deploy/audit/fpcheck DONE; **verify IN PROGRESS via FORKED conversations**
- Final verdict tally (TP / FP / DUP counts)
- **List which findings already have live-PoC** (from `vh_findings.verified='live-poc'` carried over from audit phase, plus any new live-PoC captured by FP-check artifacts) - these do NOT need a verify fork *(Automated `source` mode: there is no live-PoC and no verify fork - record all TPs as source-only and skip the fork inventory / fork prompt; see [source.md](source.md))*
- **Fork inventory** for the remaining TPs needing live verification: **one fork per finding** (each verify fork/agent covers exactly one finding)
- The **fork prompt template** ready to paste (see [verify.md](verify.md))

## Step 8 - USER GATE

> _Automated `source` mode supersedes this gate - skip the verify forks and proceed straight to report without pausing (see [source.md](source.md))._

Present:

> FP-check complete. N verdicts: X TP / Y FP / Z DUP. K TPs already have live PoC; M still need live verification.
>
> Next: open one forked conversation **per finding** that needs live verification, **from the project root**, and run them **one at a time** (serial - they share the live instance), using the fork prompt in the resume note. Each fork verifies a single finding, writes `artifacts/verify-<id>.md`, and - if confirmed as a real vuln - writes its own `artifacts/<id>-vuln-report.md` (the report phase runs in the fork; no orchestrator consolidation). (Claude Code + ultracode: drive this as a serial workflow loop instead - see [../references/workflow-orchestration.md](../references/workflow-orchestration.md).)
>
> **Before forking, confirm your working directory is the project root** - `/branch` and forks inherit the current cwd, and Claude's resume picker groups sessions by it. If the cwd has drifted into the audit dir (`<AUDIT_DIR>/`) or any subdir, `cd` back to the project root first, or the forks won't show under this project in the resume picker (lessons-learned #17).
>
> When all forks finish: come back here and say **go report** for Phase 6.
>
> **Before opening verify forks, run a manual compact here** (`/compact`). The orchestrator only needs the FP verdicts + resume note while the verify forks run - everything else (per-finding source dives, dedup reasoning) is already on disk. Each verify fork (which verifies, reviews, and writes its own `<id>-vuln-report.md`) starts in its own clean context anyway, so this compact is purely for the orchestrator.

## Quality Checks

- [ ] `vh_fp_verdicts` row count == `vh_findings` row count
- [ ] No verdict is NULL or "UNKNOWN"
- [ ] Every DUPLICATE has a valid `merged_into` finding_id
- [ ] Every FALSE_POSITIVE cites a specific HE/PR/CV rule
- [ ] Per-batch artifacts exist for all batches A..N
- [ ] Resume note includes the fork prompt template + fork inventory
