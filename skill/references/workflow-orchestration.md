# Workflow-accelerated mode (Claude Code + ultracode)

**When to use:** ONLY when the **Workflow tool is available to you** (ultracode is on, or a workflow opt-in) - i.e. you can actually call the `Workflow` tool. This is an *optional accelerator* for the full `/vibehack` pipeline and the `source` run. If you do **not** have the Workflow tool (ultracode off), **ignore this file** and run the phases the normal way, inline - the app drives phase transitions (no in-skill gates), and `source` runs unattended. This accelerator is layered on top of the default - it never replaces it.

**What it changes:** one deterministic workflow script drives the whole run instead of you executing phases by hand. Under ultracode both flows run **gateless, end-to-end**:

- `/vibehack` (full): recon → deploy → audit → fpcheck → **verify (serial)** → report.
- `source`: recon → audit → fpcheck → report (source-only; no deploy, no verify).

It also uses fresh `agent()`s, not `/branch` forks, so there is no per-fork session/cwd drift.

## Hard rules (the Workflow tool's real constraints - get these wrong and it breaks)

1. **The SCRIPT does the fan-out - never one agent "running a whole phase".** In a Workflow run a workflow `agent()` is a **leaf** - it can't spawn further workflow agents. So every per-group / per-batch / per-finding fan-out MUST be expressed in the *script* with `parallel()` / `pipeline()` / a `for`-loop, where each `agent()` does exactly **one** unit (one group, one batch, one finding). A single `agent("run the whole audit phase")` would silently **serialize** that phase's internal work. (This leaf constraint is specific to the Workflow runtime; on the **normal inline path** a mapping subagent *can* recurse and spawn helpers - see [../workflows/recon.md](../workflows/recon.md) Step 5. To get that extra depth inside a Workflow run, have recon propose **more, smaller groups** so the script fans out more `agent()`s.)
2. **Each `agent()` executes the existing `.md` for its unit - not a slash command.** Workflow agents run prompts; they cannot invoke `/vibehack:<phase>`. The prompt tells the agent to read `SKILL.md` + the relevant `workflows/<phase>.md` (+ `references/…`) and do its one unit. (This is also why there is **no recursion**: a recon step reads `recon.md`; it does not "read SKILL.md and run the full pipeline".)
3. **No nested workflows.** A `workflow()` call inside an agent throws - one workflow level only.
4. **Phases are sequential; state lives on disk.** `await` each phase before the next. Hand state between phases via the audit DB (`<AUDIT_DIR>/audit.db`) and the resume note - exactly as the inline pipeline does. Pass the absolute project root + `AUDIT_DIR` into every `agent()` (via the prompt / `args`).
5. **Run from - and keep - the project root.** Launch the workflow with the orchestrator at the project root; every `agent()` operates from the project root (artifact paths are relative to it). Never `cd` into the audit dir (Essential Principle #10).
6. **Verify is serial.** Anything that touches the live instance runs **one finding at a time** - a strict `for`-await loop (concurrency 1). Parallel live PoCs race on the shared instance's config backup/restart and produce chaos. The per-finding *static* adversarial review (verify Step 2) may fan out 2–3 **read-only** reviewers, since they re-derive from source + the captured evidence and never touch the instance - but only **one finding is ever live against the instance at a time**.
7. **Never auto-disclose.** Produce the report(s) - live full pipeline: one `artifacts/<id>-vuln-report.md` per confirmed finding, written inside the verify step (no consolidation, no `disclosure-summary.md`); source: one consolidated `report.md` with source-level reproduction guides - plus `audit.db`, print a severity summary, and stop. No external disclosure without a human.
8. **A failing `agent()` is retried or recorded, never silently absorbed.** If an `agent()` errors or returns nothing for its unit, handle it in the **script** (retry the `agent()`, or collect it and report the gap) - the orchestrator turn that launched the workflow must not quietly do that unit's work itself. This mirrors Essential Principle 11 for the inline path: a tool/agent failure is fixed and retried, not an excuse to collapse the unit's work into the main thread. (The runtime already drops a failed `agent()` to `null` so you can `.filter(Boolean)` and re-run the missing units.)

## Skeleton - `source` (source-only, gateless)

Illustrative - adapt it; the authoritative methodology for each unit lives in the phase/reference docs the agents read. `SKILL`/`recon.md`/etc. are paths under your install root (`~/.claude/skills/vibehack/`); pass `root` + `auditDir` via the Workflow `args`.

```javascript

}

const ROOT = args.root                 // absolute project root
const AUDIT = args.auditDir             // /vibe/hack/audits/<project>/audit-<ts> (absolute; recon agent creates it)
const SK = args.skillDir               // ~/.claude/skills/vibehack
const ref = `Read ${SK}/SKILL.md and work from the project root ${ROOT} (never cd into ${AUDIT}).`

## Skeleton - full `/vibehack` (gateless under ultracode: adds deploy + SERIAL verify)

Recon / audit / fpcheck are the same as the `source` skeleton **minus the source-only constraints** (audit may attempt live PoC). There is **no separate orchestrator Report phase** in the full pipeline - each confirmed finding's report is written inside the Verify loop (report.md Mode A). The deltas (deploy + serial verify-then-report):

```javascript
const DEPLOY = { type:'object', additionalProperties:false, required:['live'], properties:{
  live:{type:'boolean'}, baseUrl:{type:'string'}, livenessCmd:{type:'string'} } }

phase('Deploy')   // after Recon, before Audit
const dep = await agent(`${ref} Read ${SK}/workflows/deploy.md + references/live-instance-template.md. Bring up a LOCAL-MANAGED live instance (Docker compose / make run / build) and write the live-instance note. If you cannot bring one up unattended (e.g. it needs operator-supplied URLs/tokens), do not block - return live:false. Return {live, baseUrl, livenessCmd}.`,
  { phase:'Deploy', schema: DEPLOY })
const LIVE = dep.live   // if false, the audit + report stay source-only and Verify is skipped (auto-degrade)

// ... Audit + FP-check as above (audit may attempt live PoC only when LIVE) ...

phase('Verify')   // STRICTLY SERIAL - one finding at a time
if (LIVE) {
  const tps = await agent(`${ref} SELECT finding_id FROM vh_fp_verdicts WHERE verdict='TRUE_POSITIVE' in ${AUDIT}/audit.db. Return the ids.`, { phase:'Verify', schema: IDS })
  for (const id of tps.ids) {                                    // plain for-await => concurrency 1; do NOT wrap in parallel()
    const v = await agent(
      `${ref} Read ${SK}/workflows/verify.md + the live-instance note. LIVE-verify finding ${id} ONLY, against ${dep.baseUrl} (liveness: ${dep.livenessCmd}). Build the PoC, capture \`curl -i\`, decide CONFIRMED/REFUTED/INCONCLUSIVE, write ${AUDIT}/artifacts/verify-${id}.md. Back up any config before editing and restore at end. You are the ONLY verifier touching the instance right now.`,
      { label:`verify:${id}`, phase:'Verify' })
    if (v && /CONFIRMED/.test(v)) {                              // per-finding review - read-only reviewers, safe to parallelize
      const lenses = ['real-bug', 'valid-PoC', 'intentionally-vulnerable-or-test-code']
      await parallel(lenses.map(lens => () =>
        agent(`${ref} Read ${SK}/workflows/verify.md (Step 2). FRESH, neutral reviewer of finding ${id} via the "${lens}" lens - re-derive from source + the captured evidence in ${AUDIT}/artifacts/verify-${id}.md. Do NOT touch the live instance. Return verdict + one-line reason.`,
          { label:`review:${id}:${lens}`, phase:'Verify' })))
      await agent(`${ref} Reconcile the three reviewer verdicts for ${id} into ${AUDIT}/artifacts/verify-${id}.md (Adversarial review section); if overturned, update its Status/Severity.`, { phase:'Verify' })

      await agent(`${ref} Read ${SK}/workflows/report.md (Mode A) + references/phase6-report.md. If finding ${id} is still CONFIRMED as a real, worth-reporting vuln, write ${AUDIT}/artifacts/${id}-vuln-report.md (seven headings, incl. Vulnerability Detail = CWE(s) + CVSS 3.1 vector; Steps to reproduce as an inline command transcript - prose + $cmd + REAL captured output from verify-${id}.md, one step at a time, not one self-contained script in ANY language (a .py/.rb one-shot counts); stage only standalone helper components in poc/ referenced as poc/<name>, never an audit-dir path; lean style, no em-dashes). If it was overturned, skip the report.`,
        { label:`report:${id}`, phase:'Verify' })
    }
  }
} else {
  log('No live instance - verify skipped; findings remain source-only (not live-verified).')
}
```

## Notes

- The verify `for`-await loop is the whole point of serial verify: **do not** convert it to `parallel()`/`pipeline()`. Only the read-only per-finding review reviewers fan out.
- Resume after a stop with `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId})` - completed `agent()` calls return cached results, so a re-run continues where it left off.
- This file is **guidance**. Adapt the skeleton to the target; keep the methodology in the phase/reference docs the agents read, not duplicated in the script.
